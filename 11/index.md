# Sprint 11

Hello, I'm [Fred](https://twitter.com/_mcghief), a product manager working on beta.parliament.uk. At the end of each sprint I'm going to write an update about what the outputs team have done and what we have learned.

We're in the beta phase of research briefings. Helping people access information so they can better understand topics and debates in Parliament. 

If you'd like to read about another team, [Alan](https://twitter.com/alanmayers) writes up sprint notes for the [people team](https://ukparliament.github.io/sprintnotes.people).

## What we've done

- The MPs Guide to Procedure has been released to the wild (it's on beta and even has a link on the homepage)
- Built an analytics dashboard and started work on measuring engagement
- Built version 5 of a single page HTML briefing ready for a final round of testing
- Built a sectioned version of a briefing ready for the final round of testing to get some nice comparative evidence
- Made changes to the sticky contents bar to make it clearer to users
- Fixed some bugs that appeared after we implemented some website wide grids
- Roadmap roadmap roadmap

## What we've learned

Michael has been domain modelling with some people in the House of Commons Library. They've started the [model](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/document/document.png) for publishing research briefings and other documents but it still needs to be checked with people from the House of Lords Library and POST. Getting this done is key to getting research on beta. If it doesn't exist in the data service it doesnâ€™t exist on the website.

Guide to Procedure has been absorbed into the Outputs strand of work and it's going to have a knock-on effect on our roadmap. There are some gaps in how the content has been structured, with some collection pages being twisted into pseudo-articles but without all the right elements. Guide to Procedure works well for users, but it has moved away from the grander single unified website vision. This could cause problems later. (Future sprintnotes will have more information on this when we have learned more about it.)

Our roadmap is going to swell to absorb this piece of work in modelling the different content types, and thinking about how that applies to the rest of the website as well. It could help other teams who currently link back to the current website by creating some structure for how we publish things on the website.
